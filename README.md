Simple, responsive left/right sliding panels/drawers for desktop/mobile websites/apps


This is a very simple script that adds left/right panels/drawers to pretty much any HTML5/CSS3 website/app. Panels slide in and out using CSS3 transitions, allowing for full control over panel width, easing, speed etc.

This script was created to address the specific situation of a fixed top nav bar needing to slide at the same time as the content.
